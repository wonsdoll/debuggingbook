In particular, we want to explore techniques that _automatically_ answer questions like: Where is the bug? When does it occur? And how can we repair it? But before we start automating the debugging process, we first need to understand what this process is.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you're new to Python, you might first have to understand what the above code does.  We very much recommend the [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) to get an idea on how Python works.  The most important things for you to understand the above code are these three:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python structures programs through _indentation_, so the function and `for` bodies are defined by being indented.\n",
    "2. Python is _dynamically typed_, meaning that the type of variables like `c`, `tag`, or `out` is determined at run-time.\n",
    "3. Most of Python's syntactic features are inspired by other common languages, such as control structures (`while`, `if`, `for`), assignments (`=`), or comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`).\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, you can already understand what the above code does: `remove_html_markup()` takes a (HTML) string `s` and then iterates over the individual characters (`for c in s`). By default, these characters are added to the return string `out`. However, if `remove_html_markup()` finds a `<` character, it sets the `tag` flag, meaning that all further characters are ignored until a `>` character is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to other languages, Python makes no difference between strings and characters – there are only strings. As in HTML, strings can be enclosed in single quotes (`'a'`) and in double quotes (`\"a\"`). This is useful if you want to specify a string that contains quotes, as in `'She said \"hello\", and then left'` or `\"The first character is a 'c'\"`"
